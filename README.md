# uno

I remade UNO in python, not finished.

Currently uploaded:
  - UNO base
  - Bot - random.choice (currently draws like 20 cards)
 
 To do:
  - Make the bots more accurate/smarter
  - Add a panel/console (possibly)
  - Make it so the colours are printed as the colours, not just letters (same for wild cards)
  - Split the main.py into files that are easier to read.
