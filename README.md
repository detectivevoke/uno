# uno

I remade UNO (the game) in python, not finished.

Currently uploaded:
  - UNO base
  - Smart Bots
  - More Controlled Console


 To do:
  - Add a panel/console (possibly)
  - Make it so the colours are printed as the colours, not just letters (same for wild cards)
  - Split the main.py into files that are easier to read.
  - Split the use_card function, into many functions.
 
Update 1:
  - Bots are now smarter, making the game harder
  - Printing of your deck is now using a function to get the colour, not in the run() function itself.
